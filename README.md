This is a project that I completed for a class called "Programming Languages" at Biola University in Fall 2023. Its main function is to interpret Python-derived code and execute it using C++.
To accomplish this, I equipped it with various features, including a lexical analyzer, a helpful user interface, and a built-in calculator.
The program can interpret and execute all of the Python files included, but it is not completely polished.
